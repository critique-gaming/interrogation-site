# About

**Interrogation** is a narrative-driven conversational puzzle that deconstructs preconceptions about terrorism by putting them in a noire representation of the iconic movie interrogation scene as the investigator tasked with emotionally manipulating the suspects at hand despite realistic constraints.

# Story

The Liberation Front’s influence is expanding further and further. Whispers about the most powerful terrorist organisation in modern history are beginning to be uttered. At the heart of it, you are the investigator tasked with preventing their attacks and, perhaps, stopping them. What do these anarchists want, and how are they so capable?

You need to pierce the minds of your suspects and work your way to the truth, through intimidation, guile or empathy. You must understand their motivations and make hard choices about your methods. To what lengths are you willing to go to attain your goals?

Beyond each interrogation lies the fight against the Liberation Front. Where do you stand on their demands and their views? Will you engage in all-out war or will you attempt to get close to them? What if you get too close?

Lives are at stake.

# Gameplay

Interrogation aims to be a mature narrative puzzle game, having players piece together information, study and manipulate the emotional states of their subjects.

Outside the interrogation phases, the campaign phases ask you to decide how to allocate resources and perks, as well as to make major story decisions with consequences both immediate as well as reaching into future chapters. Ethics, morality and efficiency are all factors that will need to be balanced. Or not. Your call.

What tools will you employ to face the Liberation Front?

# Screenshots

All of Interrogation's art and sound is built around a feeling of tension. The almost-monochrome art focuses the action on the narration, pointing to the realistic nuanced personalities of the characters, while the custom music conveys the imminent danger that the player is working against and the serious nature of the challenge.
