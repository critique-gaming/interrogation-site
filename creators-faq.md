# FAQ for content creators:

We greatly appreciate your work as YouTubers, Twitch streamers, bloggers, podcasters, or, shortly: social media influencers of any kind. We would like to support your endeavors both for the gaming community and for video games in general as well as indie games in particular. That is why we try to make your work easier by trying to answer your frequently asked questions.

## Am I allowed to record or stream video content of your game and monetize it?

>You are welcome to create and publish videos (or other forms of content) of our game _Interrogation: You will be deceived_ and, if you want to, also monetize them.
This  includes videos like let's plays, reviews, tutorials, commentary, etc., both live-streamed or pre-recorded.

You do not need to request additional written permission to create such content.

## How do I get a review key?

You can request a key via [Keymailer.co](https://www.keymailer.co/g/games/31571) or [Woovit](https://woovit.com/offer/interrogation-you-will-be-deceived).
Alternatively, you can send an email to [press@interrogation-game.com](mailto:press@interrogation-game.com).

## Are there any restrictions I have to know about before I start creating my content?

No, you are good to show whatever you like.

## Does your game include any social features?

Yes, it does! If you stream the game on Twitch, you can play the _Interrogation_ collaboratively with your viewers and ask them to decide on the dialogue choices. Interrogation uses a Twitch integration to allow for votings via Twitch chat so that you can invite your viewers to an interactive experience.

To start the voting function, go to **"Settings"** and turn on **"Twitch Voting Integration"**, log in with your Twitch account (or a specially made account for the game’s chatbot) and then select your Twitch channel. The game will connect a chatbot to that channel that will listen to the chat and collect votes when you enable voting. To enable voting, click the Twitch button that will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen during interrogations or story choices.

You are not forced to follow your chat's voting - you may always chose a different option instead.

## I would like to create a custom thumbnail for my video, where do I find your logo or key art?

You can find our logo and other helpful resources like text, screenshots or videos in our press kit. Feel free to use any of them in your content.

## Can I play the game’s music in my videos or podcast?

The music used in the game is created originally for the game. You do not need to mute the game at any point while recording or streaming Interrogation.

## I make videos for an audience older than 13 years (which don’t fall under COPPA regulations). Is your game a fit?

Yes, definitely. Though _Interrogation_ doesn’t have an official age rating, it is not intended for children. In fact, we would suggest it for an age group 16+!

## I’d like you to join my stream / video / podcast or send you questions for a written interview on my blog. Is that possible?

We’re absolutely open to join you and/or answer your questions! Please send an email to press@interrogation-game.com and tell us a bit about your channel as well as your plans for the stream, video or interview, so we can sort out a good time for that.

## Can you send me extra keys for a give-away?

We only have a limited number of keys which are strictly for review purposes, so we are currently not sending out keys for giveaways.
